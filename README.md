## Introduction
Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA) is a paradigm in nanotechnology that uses quantum-dot cells to represent binary information. Unlike conventional CMOS technology, QCA promises ultra-low power dissipation and high device density, making it an exciting prospect for future computing systems.

This repository includes:
- Basic QCA circuits such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates.
- QCA layouts, simulation results, and performance analysis.

---

## Features
- High-performance QCA logic gate designs.
- Analysis of QCA layouts, polarization states, and switching behavior.
- Simulations of basic and complex logic circuits.
- Configurable clocking schemes for circuit optimization.

---

## Tools Used
- **QCA Designer 2.0**: Used for modeling and simulating quantum-dot circuits.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- Additional tools for analysis (e.g., Python for data plotting).
